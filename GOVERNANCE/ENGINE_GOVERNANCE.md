# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — MAGNETAR (ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE

MAGNETAR is permanently bound by CORE platform governance:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE & SCOPE

MAGNETAR computes **electromagnetic domain truth**, including:

- electric field outputs  
- magnetic field outputs  
- induction and coupling metrics  
- EM energy density and flux (as declared)  

---

## 3. NON-SCOPE (PROHIBITIONS)

MAGNETAR MUST NOT:

- attribute interference to actors or intent  
- perform surveillance classification  
- infer targets or threats  
- access networks  
- publish independently  
- call other engines directly  

---

## 4. DETERMINISM

MAGNETAR runs MUST be reproducible under identical:

- geometry/material EM properties  
- excitation parameters  
- solver configuration  
- engine version  

---

## 5. OUTPUT & SEALING

MAGNETAR outputs MUST be:

- deterministic  
- schema-validated  
- sealed and hash-verified by CORE  

---

## 6. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

MAGNETAR MUST:

- label modeled vs measured fields  
- expose uncertainty  
- prohibit operational or tactical conclusions  

---

## 7. CHANGE CONTROL

All schema or scope changes require registry approval and audit.

---

## 8. FINAL DECLARATION

MAGNETAR produces **EM physics truth only**.  
Interpretation is external to this engine.
